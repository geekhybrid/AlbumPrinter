**Project Structure**
The project is a simple .NET API that exposes two endpoints for placing and retrieving orders. See for yourself.

**Technical Alternatives Forgone**

The following viable technical alternatives were not considered as pragmatic approaches to solving this problem given its current scope.

1. Separating concerns into projects (i.e AlbumPrinter.Core, AlbumPrinter.Infrastructure, AlbumPrinter.Application/API)
2. Using libraries like `MediatR`, `AutoMapper`, `FluentValidator`, or any other DI container. We just enjoyed to code out most pieces today (except the database part, EF came to the rescue) ðŸ˜Ž
3. This implimentation does not consider separate environments (development, staging, production etc). Variables like connection strings are static.
4. Authentication, Authorization. Every one is welcome to place an order. No racism, No authentication, No authorization ðŸ˜„.
5. Generic repository patterns, YAGNI. (See `IOrderRepository`)
6. Introducing a service layer (say `IOrderService`) and working with those service layers in the controllers.
7. Integration tests.

**Random Thoughts That Almost Ended The World.**

1. OrderId should be generated by the API and not passed to it. Except there is a good business case why the client has that information before Order is placed.
