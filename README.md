Should OrderId be submitted or autogenerated.

I am assuming there is a good business case as to why OrderID is submitted.

As the application grows, maybe a library like MediatR may be used.

Technical Alternatives Forgone

The following technical alternatives were not considered as pragmatic approaches to solving this problem given its current scope.

1. Separating concerns into projects (i.e AlbumPrinter.Core, AlbumPrinter.Infrastructure, AlbumPrinter.Application/API)
2. Using libraries like MediatR or AutoMapper or any other DI container.
3. Introducing a service layer (say IOrderService) and working with those service layers in the controllers.
4. This implimentation does not consider separate environments (development, staging, production etc)

Recommendations

1. OrderId should be generated by the API and not passed to it. Except there is a good business case why the client has that information before Order is placed.
